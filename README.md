# DinamicHumRemoval
Automatic hum suppression in studio(audio) recordings.

The software presented here utilizes couple of outisde libraries to perform atomic functions as
spectral generation peak findings etc..

The intended use is to unsupervised suppress hum energy in audio recordings, this is the initial version without taking into consideration the hum energy distribution for the high and the low end of the spectrum, simply because funding was stoped at that point
the success rate very high even with a fixed analysis window and it is presented here as a proof of concept to anyone that whishes to pursue aditional development.
